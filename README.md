# (Slightly) Less Simple Timber
Fork of [Karunio's Simple Timber](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-timber) to add some config options that I wanted

## Plugin Commands
- /simpletimber reload - reloads plugin

## Configuration Options and Defaults
- `enabled: true`           | Whether the plugin is enabled
- `falling-animation: true` | Whether felled trees are animated
- `invert-sneak: false`     | Set to false, trees will be felled unless crouched
- `replant-saplings: false` | Should the plugin replant the trees automatically
- `log-types:`              | List of every log that can be felled, defaults to every log type

## TO-DO
- Add per player configuration
- Add option to not need saplings for replanting
