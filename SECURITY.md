## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use the github "Report Vulnerability" option if you believe there is a security flaw within the plugin.
Flaws can include, but are not limited to, permission bypasses, RCE exploits, etc.

I will try to respond as quickly as possible, expect within 24 hours. Expect to get a followup on whether I have fixed the issue or have passed it on to someone more directly concerned with the issue.
